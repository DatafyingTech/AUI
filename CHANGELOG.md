# ATM (Agent Team Manager) — Changelog

## v0.6.0 — February 25, 2026

### New Feature: Typed Variables with Sensitive Masking
- **Variable types** — variables now have a type: Text, API Key, Password, or Note. Each type has distinct visual styling with color-coded left borders (orange for API keys, red for passwords, purple for notes)
- **Sensitive value masking** — API Key and Password variables are masked by default with `****` display. An eye toggle button reveals the actual value — identical UX to the API key field in Settings
- **Note variables** — a new "Note" type renders as a multi-line textarea instead of a single-line input, perfect for context, instructions, or documentation
- **Shared VariableEditor component** — all editors (Team, Agent, Pipeline, Root) now use a unified variable editing component with consistent behavior
- **Quick-add buttons** — instead of a generic "+ Add Variable", there are now four buttons: `+ Text`, `+ API Key`, `+ Password`, `+ Note` for fast type-specific creation

### New Feature: Variables on Pipeline and Root Nodes
- **Pipeline variables** — Project Manager nodes now have a Variables section between Steps and Deploy. Variables are included in every step's deployment primer
- **Global variables** — the root "You" node now has a "Global Variables" section. These variables are passed to every team and pipeline during deployment, making them ideal for org-wide API keys, endpoints, or config
- **Deploy primer enrichment** — all primers (team deploy, pipeline deploy, skill exports) now include typed variable annotations like `[api-key] OPENAI_KEY: sk-...` for clarity

### New Feature: Version Display in Settings
- **Settings panel now shows the current ATM version** (e.g., "ATM v0.6.0") at the top of the panel, so users always know which version they're running

### Technical
- New `VariableKind` type: `"text" | "api-key" | "password" | "note"`
- `NodeVariable` interface now has a `type: VariableKind` field
- New shared component: `src/components/inspector/VariableEditor.tsx`
- Backwards-compatible migration: old variables without a `type` field default to `"text"` on load
- All primer generation (team, pipeline, skill export) updated to include variable types
- SettingsPanel shows version info badge

---

## v0.5.1 — February 25, 2026

### New Features
- **"Move to..." context menu** — right-click any node on the canvas to see a "Move to..." submenu listing all valid parent targets (Root, teams, and pipelines). Quickly reparent nodes without drag-and-drop. Excludes the node's current parent and its own descendants to prevent circular hierarchies

### Technical
- Added submenu support to `ContextMenu` component — items with a `children` array render as hover-expandable submenus with smooth open/close transitions
- Context menu "Move to Root" replaced with dynamic "Move to..." submenu that lists all groups and pipelines as reparenting targets

---

## v0.5.0 — February 25, 2026

### Rebrand: AUI → ATM (Agent Team Manager)
- **App renamed to ATM** — "Agent Team Manager" replaces "Agent UI" across the entire app
- **Window title** — now reads "ATM — Agent Team Manager"
- **Toolbar logo** — shows "ATM" with "Agent Team Manager" subtitle
- **Welcome screen** — updated to "Welcome to ATM"
- **Tauri config** — product name, identifier, and description updated
- **Package name** — `aui` → `atm` in package.json and Cargo.toml
- Note: `.aui/` config directory unchanged for backward compatibility

### New Feature: Project Manager (Pipeline Nodes)
- **New node type: Pipeline** — a sequential pipeline that runs teams one after another, with each step having its own deploy prompt
- **Magenta visual identity** — pipeline nodes appear in magenta (#d946ef) with dashed borders and a "PROJECT MGR" badge
- **Step count display** — pipeline nodes show "N steps" on the canvas, similar to how teams show agent count
- **PipelineEditor** — full inspector panel editor with:
  - Name and description fields (auto-save)
  - Ordered step list with numbered badges
  - Team dropdown per step (same team can appear multiple times)
  - Per-step deploy prompt textarea
  - Move Up/Down, Duplicate, and Delete controls per step
  - "Play All" button to deploy the entire pipeline sequentially
  - "Schedule" button to set up recurring pipeline runs
- **Sequential deployment** — "Play All" generates a primer for each step and creates a single script that runs each team's Claude session in sequence (step 1 finishes → step 2 starts → ...)
- **Pipeline scheduling** — pipelines appear in the Schedule panel's team selector with a "[Pipeline]" prefix; per-step prompts are used instead of a single deploy prompt
- **Canvas context menu** — right-click on empty canvas now shows "New Team" and "New Project Manager" (Skill option removed)
- **Create dialog** — root-level options are now "Team", "Agent", "Project Manager" (Skill removed from root); inside a team: "Agent" only

### Technical
- New `PipelineStep` interface: `{ id, teamId, prompt }`
- Added `pipelineSteps: PipelineStep[]` field to `AuiNode`
- New `NodeKind` value: `"pipeline"`
- Tree metadata groups array now stores `kind` and `pipelineSteps` for pipeline nodes
- New store methods: `createPipelineNode`, `updatePipelineSteps`, `deployPipeline`
- New component: `src/components/inspector/PipelineEditor.tsx`
- Deploy script generation produces `.ps1` (Windows) and `.sh` (macOS/Linux) scripts in `.aui/pipeline-{slug}/`

---

## v0.4.2 — February 25, 2026

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed "Failed to fetch" on Generate Teams** — API fetch errors now have proper try-catch handling with distinct messages for network errors, invalid API keys (401), and rate limits (429) instead of a generic "Failed to fetch" TypeError
- **Fixed collapsed group drag breaking child positions** — when a collapsed team is dragged, hidden children's saved positions are now offset by the drag delta so they maintain their relative positions when expanded. Previously, children would snap back to their old absolute positions
- **Fixed Generate not respecting team/agent counts** — the AI prompt now uses "EXACTLY N teams" and "EXACTLY N agents" language with strict requirements instead of "Max N" which let the LLM return fewer

### Improvements
- **Updated welcome message** — new blank layouts now show "Click the You node to get started" instead of the outdated "Double-click the canvas" instruction, and auto-selects the root node so the inspector opens immediately
- **README "At a Glance" table** — added a compact feature summary table for quick scanning by GitHub visitors

---

## v0.4.1 — February 25, 2026

### New Features
- **Node position persistence** — drag nodes to custom positions and they stay. Positions are saved per-layout and survive collapse/uncollapse, app restarts, and layout switches. Group drags save all children positions too
- **Removed duplicate generate button** — consolidated the "Generate NxN" and "Generate from Description" buttons into a single "Generate Teams" button that uses the smarter description-aware prompt
- **Removed Save buttons** — all editors now rely on autosave (from v0.4.0). Save buttons removed from RootEditor, AgentEditor, SkillEditor, and GroupEditor. Validate and Discard buttons remain where applicable

### Technical
- New tree store methods: `saveNodePosition`, `saveNodePositions`, `clearNodePosition` for position CRUD
- `layout.ts` `layoutNodes` now accepts `savedPositions` parameter — prefers saved positions over dagre-calculated defaults
- `TreeCanvas.tsx` uses ref pattern for saved positions to avoid re-layout loops on position saves
- `onNodeDragStop` saves positions for single nodes and group drags, clears on reparent
- Position cleanup in `removeNodeFromCanvas` when deleting nodes
- Removed `savedAt` state and `setSavedAt` calls from all autosave editors (dead code after button removal)

---

## v0.4.0 — February 25, 2026

### New Features
- **Autosave across all editors** — changes to any node (You, Team, Agent, Skill) now save automatically after 800ms of idle typing and on click-away. No more losing changes because you forgot to hit Save. Manual Save buttons remain for explicit saves
- **Blank layout creation** — the Layouts dropdown now has a "+ New Blank Layout" button that creates a fresh canvas with only the "You" node, perfect for building a new org structure from scratch without existing clutter
- **Edge insert button** — hover over any edge (connection line) between two nodes to reveal a "+" button. Click it to insert a new node at that position in the hierarchy, making it easy to add nodes between existing parent-child pairs

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed team deletion spawning random nodes** — removing a team node from the canvas (via the X button) no longer causes its child agents to appear at root level. Children are now recursively removed with the team, keeping the canvas clean
- **Fixed blank layout inheriting previous description** — new blank layouts now start with a truly fresh root node instead of carrying over the previous layout's "You" node description

### Technical
- New `src/hooks/useAutosave.ts` — reusable hook with debounce, skip-on-init, and flush-on-unmount for all editor components
- New `src/components/tree/InsertEdge.tsx` — custom React Flow edge component with hover-activated insert button
- `removeNodeFromCanvas` now recursively removes all descendants when removing a group node (teams), while preserving the reparent behavior for individual nodes
- `createBlankLayout` added to tree store — saves current layout, creates empty metadata, switches to blank canvas
- All 4 editor components (RootEditor, AgentEditor, SkillEditor, GroupEditor) wired with `useAutosave` hook

---

## v0.3.9 — February 24, 2026

### QA & Polish
- **Full QA audit** — comprehensive 6-area quality audit covering canvas nodes, inspector panel, layouts system, toolbar/navigation, schedule/settings, and data/build integrity. 82/83 checks passed
- **SchedulePanel toolbar overlap fixed** — panel now uses `var(--toolbar-height)` for top offset, consistent with Settings and Catalog panels
- **Consistent `@/` path aliases** — converted all remaining relative `../` imports in services and utilities to use the `@/` path alias for codebase consistency (agent-parser, file-scanner, file-watcher, file-writer, settings-parser, skill-parser, skill-scanner, validation)

### Verified
- Canvas: all 12 visual checks pass (badges, colors, tints, sub-agent detection, hover actions, collapse/expand, glow/shadow)
- Inspector: all 11 editor checks pass (routing, deploy section, schedule button, sub-agent badges, save/discard, skills, variables)
- Layouts: all 22 CRUD + edge-case checks pass (types, service, store, dropdown UI, rename, delete guards)
- Toolbar: all 11 navigation checks pass (3-section layout, button order, panel mutual exclusivity, z-index)
- Schedule: all 23 cron/schtasks/settings checks pass (Rust commands, repeat mapping, time formats, script generation, toggle/delete)
- Data layer: all 13 store/type/build checks pass (interfaces match implementations, no circular imports, tsc + vite build clean)

---

## v0.3.8 — February 24, 2026

### New Features
- **Multiple layouts** — save, switch, rename, and delete named canvas layouts. Each layout preserves the full tree hierarchy, groups, and node positions independently
- **Layouts dropdown in toolbar** — a new dropdown in the toolbar center lets you switch between saved layouts, create new ones with a name input, rename via inline editing, and delete layouts on hover
- **Layout persistence** — layout data stored as individual JSON files in `.aui/layouts/` with an `index.json` manifest tracking the active layout and metadata
- **Auto-default layout** — on first load, the current tree state is automatically saved as a "Default" layout so the system is always initialized

### Enhancements
- **Toolbar button reorder** — right-side buttons now read Catalog, Schedules, Settings (left to right) for better workflow priority. Create (+) and Layouts dropdown are centered

### Technical
- New `Layout` and `LayoutIndex` types in `src/types/aui-node.ts`
- New `src/services/layout-service.ts` — full CRUD for layout files via `@tauri-apps/plugin-fs`
- New `src/components/common/LayoutsDropdown.tsx` — dropdown UI with rename, delete, and save-as-new
- Tree store extended with `loadLayouts`, `saveCurrentAsLayout`, `switchLayout`, `deleteLayout`, `renameLayout` actions
- Layout switching auto-saves the current layout before restoring the target layout's tree metadata

---

## v0.3.7 — February 24, 2026

### Documentation
- **README overhaul** — rewrote the hero section with a clear value proposition emphasizing token efficiency and zero-overhead deployment
- **Claude Code URL install** — Quick Start now leads with a one-line paste-the-URL install option for Claude Code users, with manual clone as the alternative
- **Updated feature sections** — Interactive Org-Chart Canvas and Cron Job Scheduler sections rewritten with accurate details, node type table, and OS-level scheduling docs
- **Sub-agent documentation** — added sub-agent node type to the canvas feature section with color and badge details
- **Project structure updated** — added missing files (scheduler.ts, skill-scanner.ts) and reorganized to match the current codebase
- **Content cleanup** — removed outdated sections and polished overall structure for consistency

---

## v0.3.6 — February 24, 2026

### New Features
- **Real task scheduler backend** — schedule jobs now create actual OS-level scheduled tasks via Rust commands: Windows Task Scheduler (`schtasks.exe`) on Windows, crontab on macOS/Linux. Three new Tauri commands: `create_scheduled_task`, `list_scheduled_tasks`, `delete_scheduled_task`
- **Repeat options for schedules** — replaced raw cron expression input with a user-friendly repeat picker (Once, Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Custom cron). Time picker for selecting run time. Schedules panel shows all jobs with human-readable repeat labels
- **Custom AUI app icon** — replaced the default Tauri icon with a custom-designed AUI logo across all icon sizes (ICO, ICNS, PNG) for Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Enhancements
- **Root node badge shows "YOU"** — the root node on the canvas now displays a "YOU" badge instead of the generic kind label, making the org tree more intuitive
- **Lighter sub-agent color** — sub-agent nodes now use a softer blue (`#a5d6ff`) for better visual contrast against parent agents
- **One-command install in README** — Quick Start section now leads with a four-line clone-to-running-app snippet, plus collapsible platform-specific setup guides for Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Technical
- Added `create_scheduled_task`, `list_scheduled_tasks`, `delete_scheduled_task` Rust commands in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
- New `src/services/scheduler.ts` service for schedule persistence and OS task management
- SchedulePanel rewritten with repeat picker, time selector, and live job listing from OS

---

## v0.3.5 — February 24, 2026

### Enhancements
- **Export/Import moved to Settings panel** — the Export Tree and Import Tree buttons are now in a new "Data" section inside the Settings panel (between Preferences and Advanced), keeping the toolbar clean
- **Schedule button on team editor** — replaced the Export and Generate Skill Files buttons in the team Deploy section with a single "Schedule" button that opens the SchedulePanel directly
- **Sub-agent visual distinction** — agents nested under other agents (sub-agents) now display with a lighter blue color (`#58a6ff`), "SUB-AGENT" badge, and distinct background tint on the canvas, making the hierarchy visually clear at a glance
- **Sub-agent badges in inspector** — the agent list inside the team editor now shows "sub-agent" badges (lighter blue) for children of member-agents

### Cleanup
- Removed standalone "Export" and "Generate Skill Files" buttons from team editor (Deploy already calls `generateTeamSkillFiles` internally)
- Removed Export/Import buttons and related handlers from the Toolbar
- Toolbar reverted to clean button set: +, Settings, Schedules, Catalog

---

## v0.3.4 — February 24, 2026

### Bug Fixes
- **Deploy terminal stays open** — switched to `cmd /c start` with `raw_arg` for fully independent process detachment, so the deploy terminal no longer closes unexpectedly
- **Cleared CLAUDECODE env var in deploy scripts** — prevents nested session detection error when deploying from within an existing Claude Code session
- **Primer passed as file-read instruction** — deploy primer is now read from file instead of being passed as a 9.3KB CLI argument, fixing PowerShell argument corruption from 50 unescaped double quotes shattering the primer into 94 separate arguments
- **Node name single-quote escaping** — deploy scripts (both PS1 and bash) now properly escape single quotes in node names
- **Skill names resolve correctly in deploy primer** — primer now uses skillNameCache to resolve display names instead of falling back to raw hash IDs
- **Added Skill tool invocation instructions to primer** — deployment primer now includes instructions for agents to invoke skills

### Enhancements
- **Richer generated skill files** — skill file generation now produces thorough, opinionated content with domain-specific guidelines, quality standards, and detailed protocols (benchmarked against frontend-design quality)
- **Reordered team editor** — sections now flow: Name/Description, Deploy, Skills & Variables, Agents, Save
- **Canvas X button soft-removes nodes** — the X button on canvas nodes now removes them from the canvas without deleting files from disk (renamed to "Remove from Canvas")
- **Combined Skills & Variables** — Skills and Variables merged into a single collapsible section in the team editor
- **Generate with AI moved inside Agents section** — reduces top-level clutter in the team editor

---

## v0.3.2 — February 24, 2026

### Bug Fixes
- **Deploy terminal stays open** — fixed PowerShell `-File` flag silently ignoring `-NoExit`, causing the deploy terminal to flash and close. Switched to `-Command` invocation so the terminal persists and shows output/errors.
- **Assigning skills no longer creates phantom nodes** — fixed bug where assigning a skill to a team or root node created a visible orphan node on the canvas. Skills are now tracked in a lightweight name cache instead of being added as tree nodes.

### Enhancements
- **Collapsible sections on team editor** — the team/agent inspector now matches the root node's collapsible organization. Deploy stays prominent at the top; Variables, Assigned Skills, Generate with AI, and Agents are each collapsible sections with disclosure triangles and item counts.

### Technical
- Added `skillNameCache` to tree store for resolving skill display names without adding visible nodes
- OrgNode skill name resolution now checks: tree nodes → name cache → raw ID fallback
- Rust `open_terminal` uses `-Command` instead of `-File` on Windows for proper `-NoExit` behavior

---

## v0.3.1 — February 24, 2026

### Bug Fixes
- **Deploy now opens a visible terminal** — replaced Tauri shell plugin approach (which hardcodes `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`) with a Rust-side `open_terminal` command using `CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE`. Deploy now reliably opens a visible PowerShell window on Windows, Terminal on macOS, or any available emulator on Linux.
- **Import from GitHub URL works** — fixed "Failed to fetch" error by routing URL imports through a Rust-side `fetch_url` command, bypassing webview CORS/CSP restrictions.
- **Skill names display correctly on nodes** — fixed issue where skill tags on canvas nodes showed hash IDs instead of human-readable names. Skills are now auto-added to the tree store when assigned (#7).

### Enhancements
- **Sub-agent labels** — agent nodes nested inside teams now show "sub-agents" instead of "agents" in their child count label (#8)
- **Restructured root node inspector** — "Owner" section renamed to "Company / Project Name" with better placeholder text. Global Skills and Teams are now collapsible sections with disclosure triangles. Generate with AI moved inside the Teams section (#9)
- **Removed Chat panel** — the non-functional Chat feature has been removed from the toolbar and app since CLI-based chat cannot run inside Tauri's webview (#10)
- **Removed AI gradients** — all purple-to-blue and orange gradient buttons replaced with flat solid colors (`var(--accent-purple)`, `var(--accent-orange)`) per the frontend-design skill's guidance against generic AI aesthetics
- **39 skills installed** — downloaded and installed the full Anthropic skills pack plus community skills (algorithmic-art, canvas-design, frontend-design, mcp-builder, skill-creator, ios-simulator, playwright, d3js, web-asset-generator, and more)

### Technical
- Added `open_terminal` Rust command with platform-specific terminal launching (CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE on Windows)
- Added `fetch_url` Rust command for server-side HTTP fetching (bypasses webview restrictions)
- Overlay panels (Settings, Schedules, Catalog) are now mutually exclusive — opening one closes the others
- Toolbar reorganized: Settings, Schedules, Catalog now directly accessible (Chat removed)

---

## v0.3.0 — February 24, 2026

### UI Overhaul
- **Refined color palette** — blue-tinted dark backgrounds (#0d1117, #151b23, #1c2333) replace the old purplish tones for a more professional, modern look
- **Desaturated accents** — orange (#f0883e), green (#3fb950), purple (#8b5cf6), gold (#d29922), red (#f85149) are all slightly desaturated for less visual noise
- **Unified AI gradient** — all AI-powered buttons now use a consistent purple-to-blue gradient (`#8b5cf6 → #4a9eff`) instead of the old purple-only gradient
- **Consistent input styling** — all input fields now use CSS variables with `border-radius: 6px` and smooth `transition: border-color 0.15s`
- **Toolbar subtitle** — "Agent UI" subtitle appears next to the AUI logo for clarity
- **Better welcome screen** — improved empty state with keyboard shortcut hints and a subtitle

### UX Improvements
- **Deploy moved to top** — the Deploy section now appears at the top of the team inspector panel for faster access (was buried at the bottom)
- **Renamed "Auto-Fill"** to **"Generate with AI"** across all editors for clearer intent
- **Export button** redesigned as an outlined secondary button (was a filled gradient) to reduce visual competition with Deploy
- **Refined button hierarchy** — primary actions (Deploy, Save) are filled, secondary actions (Export, Discard) are outlined, tertiary actions (Generate Skill Files) are dashed
- **Chat, Settings, Schedules promoted to toolbar** — direct 1-click access from the toolbar instead of buried in the Menu (now renamed "Catalog")
- **"Menu" renamed to "Catalog"** — the ContextHub overlay now opens via a "Catalog" button, better reflecting its purpose as a skill/agent/team browser
- **Mutual-exclusive overlays** — opening Chat, Settings, Schedules, or Catalog automatically closes any other open overlay to prevent stacking
- **Cleaner Catalog header** — removed redundant Chat/Settings/Schedules buttons from the Catalog utility row; only Refresh and Save Plan remain
- **Inspector panel widened** to 480px (was 420px) for more comfortable editing

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+Shift+D` — deploy the currently selected team
- `Ctrl+Enter` — deploy from the deploy prompt textarea
- `Ctrl+I` — toggle the inspector panel
- Shortcuts are suppressed when typing in input fields

### Technical
- Added new CSS variables: `--bg-elevated`, `--text-tertiary`, `--border-hover`, `--accent-danger`, and radius tokens (`--radius-sm/md/lg/xl`)
- Updated team colors in grouping utility to match the new desaturated palette
- All hardcoded color values replaced with CSS variables where applicable

---

## v0.2.2 — February 23, 2026

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed deploy failing with "Make sure 'claude' is in your PATH" — root cause was Tauri v2's shell plugin hardcoding `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on all spawned processes, making every terminal invisible. Deploy now uses `ShellExecuteExW` via the shell `open()` API with a `.bat` launcher, which correctly opens a visible PowerShell window.
- Fixed Windows path handling in deploy scripts — paths now use backslashes in generated `.ps1` and `.bat` files for proper PowerShell and cmd.exe compatibility.

### Improvements
- Moved Collapse/Expand toggle from the toolbar to the floating search bar for a cleaner, more subtle placement.
- Improved deploy error messages — errors now show actual failure details instead of generic "Failed" text.

---

## v0.2.1 — February 23, 2026

### Improvements
- Added "Collapse All" / "Expand All" button in the toolbar for quick team management
- Made the entire agent count row on team nodes clickable for expand/collapse (not just the tiny arrow)
- Moved "Open Settings File" from the main menu into the Settings panel under a new "Advanced" section
- Fixed deploy to open a visible terminal window (was spawning invisible child processes)
- Cleaned up leftover references to removed features

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive USAGE.md user guide (479 lines)
- Added CONTRIBUTING.md for open-source contributors
- Added MIT LICENSE
- Enhanced README with badges, "Why AUI?" section, and contributing link
- Created 6 roadmap issues on GitHub
- Added 15 GitHub topics for search discoverability

---
